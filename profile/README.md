## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Open Visual Stimulator project! 

We are a distributed group working on different solutions for the generation and presentation of visual stimuli. Our initial field of study are neurosciences, but these could be used in any other areas people might have an interest.
Feel free to drop us a line via issues!
